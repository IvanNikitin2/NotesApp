# My Notes App

This repository contains the source code for a cross-platform notes application with a modern, clean design.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main parts:

-   `desktop-app/`: A macOS desktop application built with React, TypeScript, and Tauri. It provides a native window experience with live reload during development.

-   `mobile-app/`: A placeholder for the future iOS/Android mobile application, which will be built with React Native.

-   `backend/`: A placeholder for the future Python FastAPI backend, which will handle data synchronization, encryption, and user accounts.

See the `README.md` file in each directory for specific setup and usage instructions.
