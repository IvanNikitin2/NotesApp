# Mobile App (React Native)

This directory is a placeholder for the future iOS and Android mobile application.

## Planned Technology

The mobile app will be built using **React Native CLI** (not Expo) to allow for custom native modules and full control over the project configuration.

## Future Goals

-   **Shared UI/UX**: The design will be consistent with the macOS desktop application.
-   **Backend Integration**: It will communicate with the Python (FastAPI) backend for note synchronization and other services.
-   **Offline First**: Notes will be stored locally on the device for offline access and synced with the backend when an internet connection is available.
